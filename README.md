# COMP9001 Final Project — PackPal: Emoji Trip → Packing List

PackPal is a Python-based, command-line utility that turns simple emoji or keywords (e.g., 🏖️ 📸 3d) into a complete travel packing list. It runs offline with the standard library only and exports a shareable .txt checklist for quick printing or Padlet screenshots.

## Project Overview

PackPal showcases core programming fundamentals:
- Input/output handling (CLI, interactive prompt)
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- String/regex parsing and lightweight rule logic
- File writing (exporting the final packing list)
- Clear, modular function design

Users can:
- Combine activities and climates with emoji or words
(e.g., ⛅️ 🌩️ 🚄 🚗 🎣 🎡 3d → cloudy + storm + train + roadtrip + fishing + amusement park)
- Specify trip length; quantities auto-scale (e.g., socks per day, T-shirts per 2 days)
- Save results to packpal_output.txt for submission or printing
- Extend mappings by editing a single dictionary in code
